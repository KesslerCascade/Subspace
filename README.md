## What is Subspace?

A code modding and data collection framework for the game Faster Than Light.

## What is the design philosophy?

* Be as vanilla as possible by default. There should be NO gameplay-affecting changes.
* Only features which the user turns on are enabled. No surprises.
* Be as clear and configurable as reasonably possible.
* Compatible with any 1.6.x version of the game.
* Isolate changes to the game itself to keep them at a minimum. Anything complex goes in a separate process as to not risk game stability.

## What's left to do?

Tons. The project is still very much a work in progress and large chunks of the planned functionality are not finished, or in some cases not even started. Despite that, the basic functionality is usable and stable.
